# Airlines-Management-System
A C Language based project on Airlines Management System.

# Introduction
The mini-project “Airlines Management System Project” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiles in VSCode with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can do basic passenger record tasks like adding the passenger information, view the added passengers, search the passengers, ..etc.
The notion of Airline Manangement is based on making and canceling flight bookings. Users may simply book flights, cancel reservations, and look up information. It has a variety of booking alternatives. This tiny project has fewer features, but they are the most important ones.

# Explanation
When it comes to the features of airline booking, the system requires information such as the Passenger's Name, Passport Number, and Email Address. A reservation is made once all of these steps have been completed. The system delivers a seat number as evidence of reservation. To check tickets, the user must first submit a seat number, after which the system will search the database for the appropriate tickets and provide the results. The technology makes canceling a flight reservation simple; the user only has to enter their Passport number and seat number.

Airline Booking was created with the help of the C programming language, as well as various variables and strings. The simplest method for airplane bookings is provided by this little project.
